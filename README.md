# nlpeus
[nlpeus](https://github.com/AhmedHani/nlpeus) is a training playground for several Natural Language Processing research projects. 

I created this repository for learning, so, I am not looking forward to getting state-of-the art results for each of the implemented tasks. My main target is to educate myself in handling several projects in one repository and writing clean, generic and maintainable code that can be used for most of the tasks.

For each of the implemented task, I will illustrate the experiments done with their results.

See you at the training arena!
